In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I 
do not shrink from this responsibility -- I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any 
other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the joy
zakarta glow from that fire can truly light conquer the world.
